# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling in route handlers.

The `bug.js` file showcases a route that fetches user data from a database. It lacks proper error handling for cases where:

1.  A database error occurs.
2.  The requested user does not exist.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages to the client.  It also uses a more robust technique for error handling that is more widely used in modern node.js applications.
